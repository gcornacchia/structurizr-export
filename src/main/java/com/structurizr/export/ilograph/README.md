# Ilograph

The [IlographExporter](IlographExporter.java) class provides a way to export the software architecture model
to the YAML format used by [Ilograph](https://www.ilograph.com), which provides an interactive way to explore
a hierarchical dataset (which the C4 model is).

See https://docs.structurizr.com/export for more.
